MySQL FOSS License Exception
We want free and open source software applications under certain
licenses to be able to use specified GPL-licensed MySQL client
libraries despite the fact that not all such FOSS licenses are
compatible with version 2 of the GNU General Public License.  
Therefore there are special exceptions to the terms and conditions 
of the GPLv2 as applied to these client libraries, which are 
identified and described in more detail in the FOSS License 
Exception at 
<http://www.mysql.com/about/legal/licensing/foss-exception.html>.

GPLv2 Disclaimer
For the avoidance of doubt, except that if any license choice
other than GPL or LGPL is available it will apply instead, 
Oracle elects to use only the General Public License version 2 
(GPLv2) at this time for any software where a choice of GPL 
license versions is made available with the language indicating 
that GPLv2 or any later version may be used, or where a choice 
of which version of the GPL is applied is otherwise unspecified.
