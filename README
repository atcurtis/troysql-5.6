MySQL FOSS License Exception
We want free and open source software applications under certain
licenses to be able to use specified GPL-licensed MySQL client
libraries despite the fact that not all such FOSS licenses are
compatible with version 2 of the GNU General Public License.  
Therefore there are special exceptions to the terms and conditions 
of the GPLv2 as applied to these client libraries, which are 
identified and described in more detail in the FOSS License 
Exception at 
<http://www.mysql.com/about/legal/licensing/foss-exception.html>.
